    %h2 Brian Bommarito: On Testing
    
    %p
      This presentation will be a technology agnostic discussion on testing web applications. 
      We will learn how to create a testing workflow for a development team, the basics of 
      unit testing, using a continuous integration tool, and dealing with broken tests during 
      feature development.
    
    %p 
      This talk will also include a demo on how to test a Sinatra application with RSpec, 
      Cucumber and Hudson&mdash;a continuous integration tool.

    %h2 Alex Sharp: On Refactoring
    
    %p
      As the ruby and rails communities mature, legacy codebases, and the ability to work with
      legacy code has become a prevalent issue. Instead of dreading having to work with legacy
      code (and dreaming of "greener" pastures), I'll show how to embrace the code you have, 
      improve it, and leave it better than you found it. To borrow from Michael Feathers, we'll 
      focus on "working effectively with legacy code." ;)

    %p
      This talk will focus solving difficult refactoring problems in a real world codebase. I 
      will show actual code and demonstrate specific refactoring techniques to show how specific 
      problems were solved. This is not a conceptual talk, and thus we will look at LOTS of real 
      code. You've been warned!!

    %p
      In this session, we will cover the following:
      %ol.items
        %li 
          Educate audience on core principles of refactoring
        %li
          Present conceptual framework for approaching large refactorings
        %li
          Demonstrate common refactoring techniques, such as extract method, deprecate method, and characterization testing
        %li
          Identify common anti-patterns in web applications and specific refactoring strategies</p>

    %p
      Attendees should expect to learn core refactoring strategies and techniques, as well as 
      techniques that can be frequently applied in refactoring web applications.
