  %p
    Our roster is done! Starting July 28th, we'll be announcing a new talk every week day.

  .speaker
    %h2 Alex Sharp on Refactoring

    %p
      "This talk will focus solving difficult refactoring problems in a real world
      codebase. I will show actual code and demonstrate specific refactoring
      techniques to show how specific problems were solved. This is not a conceptual
      talk, and thus we will look at LOTS of real code. You've been warned!
    
    %p In this session, we will cover the following:
    
    %ol
      %li Educate audience on core principles of refactoring
      %li Present conceptual framework for approaching large refactorings
      %li Demonstrate common refactoring techniques, such as extract method, deprecate method, and characterization testing
      %li Identify common anti-patterns in web applications and specific refactoring strategies

    %p
      Attendees should expect to learn core refactoring strategies and techniques, 
      as well as techniques that can be frequently applied in refactoring web applications."
