  %p
    Our roster is done! Starting July 28th, we'll be announcing a new talk every week day.

  .speaker
    %h2 Luigi Montanez on How Can Ruby Change Cities, States, and Countries for the Better

    %p
      How can Ruby change cities, states, and countries for the better? Last year, we saw 
      an explosion of interest around government transparency. The Open Government movement, 
      spearheaded by open source developers, seeks to make government more accountable 
      and responsible by turning open government data into citizen-focused, 
      civic-minded applications.
      
    %p
      This talk will guide you through the Gov 2.0 landscape. You'll learn about the data 
      sets and APIs available freely available for your use, the tools and skills you'll 
      need to be a successful civic hacker, and you'll get a thorough overview of the 
      current civic apps out there. Civic hacking will enhance your open source portfolio 
      while making a difference in your community and country.

    %h2 Alex Sharp on Refactoring

    %p
      "This talk will focus solving difficult refactoring problems in a real world
      codebase. I will show actual code and demonstrate specific refactoring
      techniques to show how specific problems were solved. This is not a conceptual
      talk, and thus we will look at LOTS of real code. You've been warned!
    
    %p In this session, we will cover the following:
    
    %ol
      %li Educate audience on core principles of refactoring
      %li Present conceptual framework for approaching large refactorings
      %li Demonstrate common refactoring techniques, such as extract method, deprecate method, and characterization testing
      %li Identify common anti-patterns in web applications and specific refactoring strategies

    %p
      Attendees should expect to learn core refactoring strategies and techniques, 
      as well as techniques that can be frequently applied in refactoring web applications."
