      This presentation will be a technology agnostic discussion on testing web applications.

      unit testing, using a continuous integration tool, and dealing with broken tests during 
      feature development.

      This talk will also include a demo on how to test a Sinatra application with RSpec, 
      Cucumber and Hudson&mdash;a continuous integration tool.
